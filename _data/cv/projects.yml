  thumb: dispersal.png
  description: Models were developed to predict the movement of *Xanthomons perforans* in the field and in green house based on weather condition and other factors. Of special interest was a type-3 effector gene *XopJ2* which seemed to provide fitness for dispersal. Effect of the gene was accessed in field studies and the mechanism of fitness is being studies in green house.
- title: Mapping of resistance genes in pepper
  thumb: mapping.png
  description: Resistance genes against bacterial spot of pepper in PI163192 and UENF1381 were mapped. F2 population was developed by crossing with Early CalWonder variety. QTLs were mapped by bulked sequence analysis of whole genome sequences of resistance and susceptible bulks. HRM and CAPS markers were developed at target region and further fine-mapping was performed in backcross F2 populations.

  thumb: coffeerust.png
  description: 23 coffee varieties from previous yearâ€™s multi-season trial were scored for incidence and severity of coffee leaf rust. Three varieties **Catimor**, **Ketisic** and **San Roman** performed best against coffee rust. Increased shading, increased spacing and removal of crop debris reduced incidence. Triadimefon was effective as control agent whereas the effect of <i>Verticillium lecanii</i> was inconsistent.

  description: NARC HRD breeding lines **HRD-7** and **HRD-20**, which showed tolerance to late blight, were crossed with other breeding lines to develop hybrid lines with late blight tolerance. The lines were evaluated in field trials against commercial variety **Shrijana**. Three hybrids (HRA-14 X HRD-7, HRA-20 X HRD-1, HRA-20 X HRD-2) showed high tolerance and were recommended for multi-location coordinated varietal trial.
- title: Screening finger millet for blast resistance
  thumb: blast.png
  description: 50 finger millet accession from National Agriculture Genetic Resources Center were screened for resistance against blast cause by <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>. Plants were scored for disease severity, and AUDPC and DMRT was used for accessing level of resistance. 5 accessions showed moderate quantitative resistance and were recommended for further screening.
